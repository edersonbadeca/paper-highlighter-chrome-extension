# Page Highlighter Extension

## Overview

The **Page Highlighter Extension** is a Chrome extension designed to allow users to highlight text on any webpage easily. What makes this project unique is that it was created entirely through prompt engineering, using AI to generate the code step by step based on user inputs and requirements.

## Features

- **Text Highlighting**: Highlight selected text on any webpage with a simple keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+I` or `Command+I` on Mac).
- **Save Highlights**: Automatically save highlighted text along with the URL of the page for easy reference later.
- **View and Manage Highlights**: A popup interface lets you view all saved highlights and clear them if needed.
- **Custom Icons**: Includes a custom icon set for a personalized extension experience.
- **Efficient Workflow**: All features were implemented based on iterative AI-assisted development, highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in real-world applications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/page-highlighter-extension.git
    \`\`\`
2. **Open Chrome Extensions**:
    - Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
    - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
    - Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.

3. **Use the Extension**:
    - Select text on any webpage.
    - Press `Ctrl+I` (or `Command+I` on Mac) to highlight the text.
    - Open the extension popup to view and manage your highlights.

## How It Was Built

This extension is a testament to the power of AI and prompt engineering. Every aspect of the extension, from the code to the design and feature set, was developed through iterative prompts with an AI assistant. This approach demonstrates how developers can leverage AI to rapidly prototype and create functional tools without writing code from scratch.
