# List of Prompts Used to Build the Extension

1. **Is there a Chrome extension for highlighting text on pages I’m reading?**
2. **Those are blocked by the company. Let’s build our own, shall we?**
3. **I tried importing it and got this error.** (Image of the error when loading the extension)
4. **Another error, man.** (Image of an error related to the inline script)
5. **Nothing happened, just this box shows up, and it doesn't highlight anything.** (Image of the non-functional extension)
6. **Now it’s working! I want to save the highlights and be able to view a list of saved highlights.**
7. **In the highlights view, let’s show the page where the text was highlighted and add a button to copy the text to the clipboard.**
8. **And besides highlighting, can we draw shapes on the page?**
9. **I was wondering, can I highlight text using a keyboard shortcut?**
10. **Can we add it to the right-click context menu?** (Image of the context menu)
11. **I want the shortcut to be `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`.**
12. **Change the shortcut to `Ctrl+I`.**
13. **Nice, can you generate an image of a highlighter pen marking text on a webpage?**
14. **Draw just the highlighter pen.**
15. **In the manifest, add the icon: `icon.png`.**
16. **Awesome. Let’s version this on GitHub. Can you write a cool README in English explaining that this extension was created entirely via prompt engineering?**
17. **Alright, generate the README for me so I can put it in the repo.**
18. **Can you show a list of all the prompts we used here so I can include it in the repo too?**

This list documents the entire prompt engineering process that guided the creation of the extension. It showcases the step-by-step journey and decisions made through iterative conversations.
